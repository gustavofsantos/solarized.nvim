# Solarized Colorscheme

Yes, it's another port of the Solarized theme.

What's different in this one? Nothing, I think. It's just the Solarized theme
forked from its original source (from Ethan's repo) with some customizations to
make it more comfortable to me.

## Installation

Through lazy:

```lua
{
    "gustavofsantos/solarized.nvim",
    priority = 1000,
    opts = {},
    config = function()
      vim.cmd([[colorscheme solarized]])
    end,
}
```
